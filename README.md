# Battleship
A replica of the game Battleship made with Java and love.

This was our cumulative project for grade 11 computer science. It was our first real venture into GUI design and implementation, as well as algorithm creation.

Not going to lie, our win rate was only about 75% with this basic algorithm to decide on our AI's next move. But, you'll be hard pressed to find a better boat icon when looking through the projects of our classmates.

The majority of my work on this project lies in the design and creation of the GUI. The rest lies in the code for updating the score when a battleship was hit, checking for win conditions, and placing the ships in different locations each time the program was run.

While I only preset three different combinations of setting up our ships, I did utilize file I/O to change the set-up for each consecutive execution of our game.

# TO DO
  - change the ships from arrays to objects (to make use of object oriented program and increase speed)
  - improve the algorithm to determine the next target
  - update the design of the GUI to make it look more similar to typical Battleship games (bring back the nostalgia)
